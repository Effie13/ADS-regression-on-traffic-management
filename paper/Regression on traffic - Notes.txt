6, In this thesis work, we give a brief survey of recent researches on road traffic prediction and propose an 
innovative approach to estimate road traffic flow using regression analysis for the roads of Porto city

--> apply regression to predict road traffic flow in long-term based on historical traffic data and compare their performance

7. This paper analyzes several regression methods, such as the principal component regression (PCR), partial least square regression (PLSR), and builds models between incident duration and its influence factors.
